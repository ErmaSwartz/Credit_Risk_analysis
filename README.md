# Credit_Risk_analysis
### Summary 
##### This analysis looks at several different variables and their impact on fuel efficieny. These five variables (our independent variables) are vehicle size, ground clearance, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and all wheel drive. The hypothesis is that there is an impact based on these variables on the efficieny of the car. Our null hypothesis is that there is no causational relationship between the independent variables and the fuel effiency of any given vehicle.

### Analysis of accuracy scores 
#### The accuracy score we accomplish in our credit risk ensemble is a perfect score of one. This either means this was the best model to employ when trying to prove our hypthesis to be correct, or that something went wrong within the model and made the score too perfect. It is also possible that the model was subject to overfitting and despite giving us a perfect score, is not a good model because it has become to specific to this data set. Either this model or the combination over and undersampling should be used as they have the highest accuracy scores.
